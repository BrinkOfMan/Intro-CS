JOHN MILTON
BOOK 1
THE ARGUMENT
THIS FIRST BOOK PROPOSES, FIRST IN BRIEF, THE WHOLE SUBJECT, MANS DISOBEDIENCE, AND THE LOSS THEREUPON OF PARADISE WHEREIN HE WAS PLAC'T: THEN TOUCHES THE PRIME CAUSE OF HIS FALL, THE SERPENT, OR RATHER SATAN IN THE SERPENT; WHO REVOLTING FROM GOD, AND DRAWING TO HIS SIDE MANY LEGIONS OF ANGELS, WAS BY THE COMMAND OF GOD DRIVEN OUT OF HEAVEN WITH ALL HIS CREW INTO THE GREAT DEEP. WHICH ACTION PAST OVER, THE POEM HASTS INTO THE MIDST OF THINGS, PRESENTING SATAN WITH HIS ANGELS NOW FALLEN INTO HELL, DESCRIB'D HERE, NOT IN THE CENTER (FOR HEAVEN AND EARTH MAY BE SUPPOS'D AS YET NOT MADE, CERTAINLY NOT YET ACCURST) BUT IN A PLACE OF UTTER DARKNESS, FITLIEST CALL'D CHAOS: HERE SATAN WITH HIS ANGELS LYING ON THE BURNING LAKE, THUNDER-STRUCK AND ASTONISHT, AFTER A CERTAIN SPACE RECOVERS, AS FROM CONFUSION, CALLS UP HIM WHO NEXT IN ORDER AND DIGNITY LAY BY HIM; THEY CONFER OF THIR MISERABLE FALL. SATAN AWAKENS ALL HIS LEGIONS, WHO LAY TILL THEN IN THE SAME MANNER CONFOUNDED; THEY RISE, THIR NUMBERS, ARRAY OF BATTEL, THIR CHIEF LEADERS NAM'D, ACCORDING TO THE IDOLS KNOWN AFTERWARDS IN CANAAN AND THE COUNTRIES ADJOYNING. TO THESE SATAN DIRECTS HIS SPEECH, COMFORTS THEM WITH HOPE YET OF REGAINING HEAVEN, BUT TELLS THEM LASTLY OF A NEW WORLD AND NEW KIND OF CREATURE TO BE CREATED, ACCORDING TO AN ANCIENT PROPHESIE OR REPORT IN HEAVEN; FOR THAT ANGELS WERE LONG BEFORE THIS VISIBLE CREATION, WAS THE OPINION OF MANY ANCIENT FATHERS. TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH OF THIS PROPHESIE, AND WHAT TO DETERMIN THEREON HE REFERS TO A FULL COUNCEL. WHAT HIS ASSOCIATES THENCE ATTEMPT. PANDEMONIUM THE PALACE OF SATAN RISES, SUDDENLY BUILT OUT OF THE DEEP: THE INFERNAL PEERS THERE SIT IN COUNCEL.
OF MANS FIRST DISOBEDIENCE, AND THE FRUIT
BROUGHT DEATH INTO THE WORLD, AND ALL OUR WOE,
RESTORE US, AND REGAIN THE BLISSFUL SEAT, [ 5 ]
OF OREB, OR OF SINAI, DIDST INSPIRE
IN THE BEGINNING HOW THE HEAV'NS AND EARTH
DELIGHT THEE MORE, AND SILOA'S BROOK THAT FLOW'D
INVOKE THY AID TO MY ADVENTROUS SONG,
ABOVE TH' AONIAN MOUNT, WHILE IT PURSUES [ 15 ]
AND CHIEFLY THOU O SPIRIT, THAT DOST PREFER
INSTRUCT ME, FOR THOU KNOW'ST; THOU FROM THE FIRST
DOVE-LIKE SATST BROODING ON THE VAST ABYSS
ILLUMIN, WHAT IS LOW RAISE AND SUPPORT;
I MAY ASSERT ETERNAL PROVIDENCE, [ 25 ]

NOR THE DEEP TRACT OF HELL, SAY FIRST WHAT CAUSE
FAVOUR'D OF HEAV'N SO HIGHLY, TO FALL OFF [ 30 ]
FOR ONE RESTRAINT, LORDS OF THE WORLD BESIDES?
TH' INFERNAL SERPENT; HE IT WAS, WHOSE GUILE
THE MOTHER OF MANKIND, WHAT TIME HIS PRIDE
OF REBEL ANGELS, BY WHOSE AID ASPIRING
HE TRUSTED TO HAVE EQUAL'D THE MOST HIGH, [ 40 ]
AGAINST THE THRONE AND MONARCHY OF GOD
WITH VAIN ATTEMPT. HIM THE ALMIGHTY POWER
WITH HIDEOUS RUINE AND COMBUSTION DOWN
IN ADAMANTINE CHAINS AND PENAL FIRE,
NINE TIMES THE SPACE THAT MEASURES DAY AND NIGHT [ 50 ]
LAY VANQUISHT, ROWLING IN THE FIERY GULFE
RESERV'D HIM TO MORE WRATH; FOR NOW THE THOUGHT
TORMENTS HIM; ROUND HE THROWS HIS BALEFUL EYES
MIXT WITH OBDURATE PRIDE AND STEDFAST HATE:
THE DISMAL SITUATION WASTE AND WILDE, [ 60 ]
AS ONE GREAT FURNACE FLAM'D, YET FROM THOSE FLAMES
SERV'D ONELY TO DISCOVER SIGHTS OF WOE,
AND REST CAN NEVER DWELL, HOPE NEVER COMES
STILL URGES, AND A FIERY DELUGE, FED
SUCH PLACE ETERNAL JUSTICE HAD PREPAR'D [ 70 ]
IN UTTER DARKNESS, AND THIR PORTION SET
AS FROM THE CENTER THRICE TO TH' UTMOST POLE.
THERE THE COMPANIONS OF HIS FALL, O'REWHELM'D
HE SOON DISCERNS, AND WELTRING BY HIS SIDE
LONG AFTER KNOWN IN PALESTINE, AND NAM'D [ 80 ]
AND THENCE IN HEAV'N CALL'D SATAN, WITH BOLD WORDS

FROM HIM, WHO IN THE HAPPY REALMS OF LIGHT [ 85 ]
MYRIADS THOUGH BRIGHT: IF HE WHOM MUTUAL LEAGUE,
AND HAZARD IN THE GLORIOUS ENTERPRIZE,
IN EQUAL RUIN: INTO WHAT PIT THOU SEEST
HE WITH HIS THUNDER: AND TILL THEN WHO KNEW
NOR WHAT THE POTENT VICTOR IN HIS RAGE [ 95 ]
THOUGH CHANG'D IN OUTWARD LUSTRE; THAT FIXT MIND
THAT WITH THE MIGHTIEST RAIS'D ME TO CONTEND,
INNUMERABLE FORCE OF SPIRITS ARM'D
HIS UTMOST POWER WITH ADVERSE POWER OPPOS'D
AND SHOOK HIS THRONE. WHAT THOUGH THE FIELD BE LOST? [ 105 ]
AND STUDY OF REVENGE, IMMORTAL HATE,
AND WHAT IS ELSE NOT TO BE OVERCOME?
EXTORT FROM ME. TO BOW AND SUE FOR GRACE
WHO FROM THE TERROUR OF THIS ARM SO LATE
THAT WERE AN IGNOMINY AND SHAME BENEATH [ 115 ]
AND THIS EMPYREAL SUBSTANCE CANNOT FAIL,
IN ARMS NOT WORSE, IN FORESIGHT MUCH ADVANC'T,
TO WAGE BY FORCE OR GUILE ETERNAL WARR
WHO NOW TRIUMPHS, AND IN TH' EXCESS OF JOY

VAUNTING ALOUD, BUT RACKT WITH DEEP DESPARE:

THAT LED TH' IMBATTELLD SERAPHIM TO WARR
FEARLESS, ENDANGER'D HEAV'NS PERPETUAL KING;
WHETHER UPHELD BY STRENGTH, OR CHANCE, OR FATE,
THAT WITH SAD OVERTHROW AND FOUL DEFEAT [ 135 ]
IN HORRIBLE DESTRUCTION LAID THUS LOW,
CAN PERISH: FOR THE MIND AND SPIRIT REMAINS
THOUGH ALL OUR GLORY EXTINCT, AND HAPPY STATE
BUT WHAT IF HE OUR CONQUEROUR, (WHOM I NOW
THEN SUCH COULD HAV OREPOW'RD SUCH FORCE AS OURS) [ 145 ]
STRONGLY TO SUFFER AND SUPPORT OUR PAINS,
OR DO HIM MIGHTIER SERVICE AS HIS THRALLS
HERE IN THE HEART OF HELL TO WORK IN FIRE,
WHAT CAN IT THEN AVAIL THOUGH YET WE FEEL
TO UNDERGO ETERNAL PUNISHMENT? [ 155 ]

DOING OR SUFFERING: BUT OF THIS BE SURE,
BUT EVER TO DO ILL OUR SOLE DELIGHT, [ 160 ]
WHOM WE RESIST. IF THEN HIS PROVIDENCE
OUR LABOUR MUST BE TO PERVERT THAT END,
WHICH OFT TIMES MAY SUCCEED, SO AS PERHAPS
HIS INMOST COUNSELS FROM THIR DESTIND AIM.
HIS MINISTERS OF VENGEANCE AND PURSUIT [ 170 ]
SHOT AFTER US IN STORM, OREBLOWN HATH LAID
OF HEAV'N RECEIV'D US FALLING, AND THE THUNDER,
PERHAPS HATH SPENT HIS SHAFTS, AND CEASES NOW
LET US NOT SLIP TH' OCCASION, WHETHER SCORN,
SEEST THOU YON DREARY PLAIN, FORLORN AND WILDE, [ 180 ]
SAVE WHAT THE GLIMMERING OF THESE LIVID FLAMES
FROM OFF THE TOSSING OF THESE FIERY WAVES,
AND REASSEMBLING OUR AFFLICTED POWERS,
OUR ENEMY, OUR OWN LOSS HOW REPAIR,
WHAT REINFORCEMENT WE MAY GAIN FROM HOPE, [ 190 ]

WITH HEAD UP-LIFT ABOVE THE WAVE, AND EYES
PRONE ON THE FLOOD, EXTENDED LONG AND LARGE [ 195 ]
AS WHOM THE FABLES NAME OF MONSTROUS SIZE,
BRIAREOS OR TYPHON, WHOM THE DEN
LEVIATHAN, WHICH GOD OF ALL HIS WORKS
HIM HAPLY SLUMBRING ON THE NORWAY FOAM
DEEMING SOME ISLAND, OFT, AS SEA-MEN TELL, [ 205 ]
MOORS BY HIS SIDE UNDER THE LEE, WHILE NIGHT
SO STRETCHT OUT HUGE IN LENGTH THE ARCH-FIEND LAY
HAD RIS'N OR HEAV'D HIS HEAD, BUT THAT THE WILL
LEFT HIM AT LARGE TO HIS OWN DARK DESIGNS,
HEAP ON HIMSELF DAMNATION, WHILE HE SOUGHT [ 215 ]
HOW ALL HIS MALICE SERV'D BUT TO BRING FORTH
ON MAN BY HIM SEDUC'T, BUT ON HIMSELF
FORTHWITH UPRIGHT HE REARS FROM OFF THE POOL
DRIVN BACKWARD SLOPE THIR POINTING SPIRES, AND ROWLD
THEN WITH EXPANDED WINGS HE STEARS HIS FLIGHT [ 225 ]
THAT FELT UNUSUAL WEIGHT, TILL ON DRY LAND
WITH SOLID, AS THE LAKE WITH LIQUID FIRE;
OF SUBTERRANEAN WIND TRANSPORTS A HILL
OF THUNDRING AETNA, WHOSE COMBUSTIBLE
SUBLIM'D WITH MINERAL FURY, AID THE WINDS, [ 235 ]
WITH STENCH AND SMOAK: SUCH RESTING FOUND THE SOLE
BOTH GLORYING TO HAVE SCAP'T THE STYGIAN FLOOD
NOT BY THE SUFFERANCE OF SUPERNAL POWER.
IS THIS THE REGION, THIS THE SOIL, THE CLIME,
THAT WE MUST CHANGE FOR HEAV'N, THIS MOURNFUL GLOOM
WHO NOW IS SOVRAN CAN DISPOSE AND BID
WHOM REASON HATH EQUALD, FORCE HATH MADE SUPREAM
WHERE JOY FOR EVER DWELLS: HAIL HORROURS, HAIL [ 250 ]
RECEIVE THY NEW POSSESSOR: ONE WHO BRINGS
THE MIND IS ITS OWN PLACE, AND IN IT SELF
WHAT MATTER WHERE, IF I BE STILL THE SAME,
WHOM THUNDER HATH MADE GREATER? HERE AT LEAST
HERE FOR HIS ENVY, WILL NOT DRIVE US HENCE: [ 260 ]
TO REIGN IS WORTH AMBITION THOUGH IN HELL:
BUT WHEREFORE LET WE THEN OUR FAITHFUL FRIENDS,
LYE THUS ASTONISHT ON TH' OBLIVIOUS POOL,
IN THIS UNHAPPY MANSION, OR ONCE MORE
REGAIND IN HEAV'N, OR WHAT MORE LOST IN HELL? [ 270 ]
SO SATAN SPAKE, AND HIM BEELZEBUB
WHICH BUT TH' ONMIPOTENT NONE COULD HAVE FOYLD,
OF HOPE IN FEARS AND DANGERS, HEARD SO OFT [ 275 ]
OF BATTEL WHEN IT RAG'D, IN ALL ASSAULTS
NEW COURAGE AND REVIVE, THOUGH NOW THEY LYE
AS WE EREWHILE, ASTOUNDED AND AMAZ'D,

WAS MOVING TOWARD THE SHOAR; HIS PONDEROUS SHIELD
BEHIND HIM CAST; THE BROAD CIRCUMFERENCE
THROUGH OPTIC GLASS THE TUSCAN ARTIST VIEWS
OR IN VALDARNO, TO DESCRY NEW LANDS, [ 290 ]
HIS SPEAR, TO EQUAL WHICH THE TALLEST PINE
OF SOME GREAT AMMIRAL, WERE BUT A WAND,
OVER THE BURNING MARLE, NOT LIKE THOSE STEPS
SMOTE ON HIM SORE BESIDES, VAULTED WITH FIRE;
OF THAT INFLAMED SEA, HE STOOD AND CALL'D [ 300 ]
THICK AS AUTUMNAL LEAVES THAT STROW THE BROOKS
HIGH OVERARCH'T IMBOWR; OR SCATTERD SEDGE
HATH VEXT THE RED-SEA COAST, WHOSE WAVES ORETHREW
WHILE WITH PERFIDIOUS HATRED THEY PURSU'D
FROM THE SAFE SHORE THIR FLOATING CARKASES [ 310 ]
ABJECT AND LOST LAY THESE, COVERING THE FLOOD,
HE CALL'D SO LOUD, THAT ALL THE HOLLOW DEEP
WARRIERS, THE FLOWR OF HEAV'N, ONCE YOURS, NOW LOST,
ETERNAL SPIRITS; OR HAVE YE CHOS'N THIS PLACE
YOUR WEARIED VERTUE, FOR THE EASE YOU FIND [ 320 ]
OR IN THIS ABJECT POSTURE HAVE YE SWORN
CHERUBE AND SERAPH ROWLING IN THE FLOOD
HIS SWIFT PURSUERS FROM HEAV'N GATES DISCERN
THUS DROOPING, OR WITH LINKED THUNDERBOLTS
AWAKE, ARISE, OR BE FOR EVER FALL'N. [ 330 ]
THEY HEARD, AND WERE ABASHT, AND UP THEY SPRUNG
ON DUTY, SLEEPING FOUND BY WHOM THEY DREAD,
NOR DID THEY NOT PERCEAVE THE EVIL PLIGHT [ 335 ]
YET TO THIR GENERALS VOYCE THEY SOON OBEYD
OF AMRAMS SON IN EGYPTS EVILL DAY
OF LOCUSTS, WARPING ON THE EASTERN WIND,
LIKE NIGHT, AND DARKEN'D ALL THE LAND OF NILE:
HOVERING ON WING UNDER THE COPE OF HELL [ 345 ]
TILL, AS A SIGNAL GIV'N, TH' UPLIFTED SPEAR
THIR COURSE, IN EVEN BALLANCE DOWN THEY LIGHT
A MULTITUDE, LIKE WHICH THE POPULOUS NORTH
RHENE OR THE DANAW, WHEN HER BARBAROUS SONS
BENEATH GIBRALTER TO THE LYBIAN SANDS. [ 355 ]
THE HEADS AND LEADERS THITHER HAST WHERE STOOD
EXCELLING HUMAN, PRINCELY DIGNITIES,
THOUGH OF THIR NAMES IN HEAV'NLY RECORDS NOW
BY THIR REBELLION, FROM THE BOOKS OF LIFE.
GOT THEM NEW NAMES, TILL WANDRING ORE THE EARTH, [ 365 ]
BY FALSITIES AND LYES THE GREATEST PART
GOD THIR CREATOR, AND TH' INVISIBLE
OFT TO THE IMAGE OF A BRUTE, ADORN'D
AND DEVILS TO ADORE FOR DEITIES:
AND VARIOUS IDOLS THROUGH THE HEATHEN WORLD. [ 375 ]
ROUS'D FROM THE SLUMBER, ON THAT FIERY COUCH,
CAME SINGLY WHERE HE STOOD ON THE BARE STRAND,
THE CHIEF WERE THOSE WHO FROM THE PIT OF HELL
THIR SEATS LONG AFTER NEXT THE SEAT OF GOD,
AMONG THE NATIONS ROUND, AND DURST ABIDE [ 385 ]
BETWEEN THE CHERUBIM; YEA, OFTEN PLAC'D
ABOMINATIONS; AND WITH CURSED THINGS
AND WITH THIR DARKNESS DURST AFFRONT HIS LIGHT.
OF HUMAN SACRIFICE, AND PARENTS TEARS,
THIR CHILDRENS CRIES UNHEARD, THAT PAST THROUGH FIRE [ 395 ]
WORSHIPT IN RABBA AND HER WATRY PLAIN,
OF UTMOST ARNON. NOR CONTENT WITH SUCH
OF SOLOMON HE LED BY FRAUD TO BUILD
ON THAT OPPROBRIOUS HILL, AND MADE HIS GROVE
AND BLACK GEHENNA CALL'D, THE TYPE OF HELL. [ 405 ]
FROM AROAR TO NEBO, AND THE WILD
AND HORONAIM, SEONS REALM, BEYOND
AND ELEALE TO TH' ASPHALTICK POOL.
ISRAEL IN SITTIM ON THIR MARCH FROM NILE
YET THENCE HIS LUSTFUL ORGIES HE ENLARG'D [ 415 ]
OF MOLOCH HOMICIDE, LUST HARD BY HATE;
WITH THESE CAME THEY, WHO FROM THE BORDRING FLOOD
EGYPT FROM SYRIAN GROUND, HAD GENERAL NAMES
THESE FEMININE. FOR SPIRITS WHEN THEY PLEASE
AND UNCOMPOUNDED IS THIR ESSENCE PURE, [ 425 ]
NOR FOUNDED ON THE BRITTLE STRENGTH OF BONES,
DILATED OR CONDENS'T, BRIGHT OR OBSCURE,
AND WORKS OF LOVE OR ENMITY FULFILL.
THIR LIVING STRENGTH, AND UNFREQUENTED LEFT
TO BESTIAL GODS; FOR WHICH THIR HEADS AS LOW [ 435 ]
OF DESPICABLE FOES. WITH THESE IN TROOP
ASTARTE, QUEEN OF HEAV'N, WITH CRESCENT HORNS;
SIDONIAN VIRGINS PAID THIR VOWS AND SONGS,
HER TEMPLE ON TH' OFFENSIVE MOUNTAIN, BUILT
BEGUIL'D BY FAIR IDOLATRESSES, FELL [ 445 ]
WHOSE ANNUAL WOUND IN LEBANON ALLUR'D
IN AMOROUS DITTYES ALL A SUMMERS DAY,
RAN PURPLE TO THE SEA, SUPPOS'D WITH BLOOD
INFECTED SIONS DAUGHTERS WITH LIKE HEAT,
EZEKIEL SAW, WHEN BY THE VISION LED [ 455 ]
OF ALIENATED JUDAH. NEXT CAME ONE
MAIM'D HIS BRUTE IMAGE, HEAD AND HANDS LOPT OFF
WHERE HE FELL FLAT, AND SHAM'D HIS WORSHIPERS:
AND DOWNWARD FISH: YET HAD HIS TEMPLE HIGH
OF PALESTINE, IN GATH AND ASCALON [ 465 ]
HIM FOLLOW'D RIMMON, WHOSE DELIGHTFUL SEAT
OF ABBANA AND PHARPHAR, LUCID STREAMS.
A LEPER ONCE HE LOST AND GAIN'D A KING,
GODS ALTAR TO DISPARAGE AND DISPLACE
HIS ODIOUS OFF'RINGS, AND ADORE THE GODS [ 475 ]
A CREW WHO UNDER NAMES OF OLD RENOWN,
WITH MONSTROUS SHAPES AND SORCERIES ABUS'D
THIR WANDRING GODS DISGUIS'D IN BRUTISH FORMS
TH' INFECTION WHEN THIR BORROW'D GOLD COMPOS'D
DOUBL'D THAT SIN IN BETHEL AND IN DAN, [ 485 ]
JEHOVAH, WHO IN ONE NIGHT WHEN HE PASS'D
BOTH HER FIRST BORN AND ALL HER BLEATING GODS.
FELL NOT FROM HEAVEN, OR MORE GROSS TO LOVE
OR ALTAR SMOAK'D; YET WHO MORE OFT THEN HEE
TURNS ATHEIST, AS DID ELY'S SONS, WHO FILL'D [ 495 ]
IN COURTS AND PALACES HE ALSO REIGNS
OF RIOT ASCENDS ABOVE THIR LOFTIEST TOWRS,
DARKENS THE STREETS, THEN WANDER FORTH THE SONS
WITNESS THE STREETS OF SODOM, AND THAT NIGHT
EXPOS'D A MATRON TO AVOID WORSE RAPE. [ 505 ]
THE REST WERE LONG TO TELL, THOUGH FAR RENOWN'D,
GODS, YET CONFEST LATER THEN HEAV'N AND EARTH
WITH HIS ENORMOUS BROOD, AND BIRTHRIGHT SEIS'D
HIS OWN AND RHEA'S SON LIKE MEASURE FOUND;
AND IDA KNOWN, THENCE ON THE SNOWY TOP [ 515 ]
THIR HIGHEST HEAV'N; OR ON THE DELPHIAN CLIFF,
OF DORIC LAND; OR WHO WITH SATURN OLD
AND ORE THE CELTIC ROAM'D THE UTMOST ISLES.
DOWN CAST AND DAMP, YET SUCH WHEREIN APPEAR'D
NOT IN DESPAIR, TO HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES NOT LOST [ 525 ]
LIKE DOUBTFUL HUE: BUT HE HIS WONTED PRIDE
SEMBLANCE OF WORTH, NOT SUBSTANCE, GENTLY RAIS'D
THEN STRAIT COMMANDS THAT AT THE WARLIKE SOUND
HIS MIGHTY STANDARD; THAT PROUD HONOUR CLAIM'D
WHO FORTHWITH FROM THE GLITTERING STAFF UNFURLD [ 535 ]
SHON LIKE A METEOR STREAMING TO THE WIND
SERAPHIC ARMS AND TROPHIES: ALL THE WHILE
AT WHICH THE UNIVERSAL HOST UPSENT
FRIGHTED THE REIGN OF CHAOS AND OLD NIGHT.
TEN THOUSAND BANNERS RISE INTO THE AIR [ 545 ]
A FOREST HUGE OF SPEARS: AND THRONGING HELMS
OF DEPTH IMMEASURABLE: ANON THEY MOVE
OF FLUTES AND SOFT RECORDERS; SUCH AS RAIS'D
ARMING TO BATTEL, AND IN STEAD OF RAGE
WITH DREAD OF DEATH TO FLIGHT OR FOUL RETREAT, [ 555 ]
WITH SOLEMN TOUCHES, TROUBL'D THOUGHTS, AND CHASE
FROM MORTAL OR IMMORTAL MINDS. THUS THEY
MOV'D ON IN SILENCE TO SOFT PIPES THAT CHARM'D
ADVANC'T IN VIEW, THEY STAND, A HORRID FRONT
OF WARRIERS OLD WITH ORDER'D SPEAR AND SHIELD, [ 565 ]
HAD TO IMPOSE: HE THROUGH THE ARMED FILES
THE WHOLE BATTALION VIEWS, THIR ORDER DUE,
THIR NUMBER LAST HE SUMMS. AND NOW HIS HEART
GLORIES: FOR NEVER SINCE CREATED MAN,
COULD MERIT MORE THEN THAT SMALL INFANTRY [ 575 ]
OF PHLEGRA WITH TH' HEROIC RACE WERE JOYN'D
MIXT WITH AUXILIAR GODS; AND WHAT RESOUNDS
BEGIRT WITH BRITISH AND ARMORIC KNIGHTS;
JOUSTED IN ASPRAMONT OR MONTALBAN,
OR WHOM BISERTA SENT FROM AFRIC SHORE [ 585 ]
BY FONTARABBIA. THUS FAR THESE BEYOND
THIR DREAD COMMANDER: HE ABOVE THE REST
STOOD LIKE A TOWR; HIS FORM HAD YET NOT LOST
LESS THEN ARCH ANGEL RUIND, AND TH' EXCESS
LOOKS THROUGH THE HORIZONTAL MISTY AIR [ 595 ]
IN DIM ECLIPS DISASTROUS TWILIGHT SHEDS
PERPLEXES MONARCHS. DARK'N'D SO, YET SHON
DEEP SCARS OF THUNDER HAD INTRENCHT, AND CARE
OF DAUNTLESS COURAGE, AND CONSIDERATE PRIDE
SIGNS OF REMORSE AND PASSION TO BEHOLD [ 605 ]
(FAR OTHER ONCE BEHELD IN BLISS) CONDEMN'D
MILLIONS OF SPIRITS FOR HIS FAULT AMERC'T
FOR HIS REVOLT, YET FAITHFULL HOW THEY STOOD,
HATH SCATH'D THE FORREST OAKS, OR MOUNTAIN PINES,
STANDS ON THE BLASTED HEATH. HE NOW PREPAR'D [ 615 ]
FROM WING TO WING, AND HALF ENCLOSE HIM ROUND
THRICE HE ASSAYD, AND THRICE IN SPIGHT OF SCORN,
WORDS INTERWOVE WITH SIGHS FOUND OUT THIR WAY.
O MYRIADS OF IMMORTAL SPIRITS, O POWERS
WAS NOT INGLORIOUS, THOUGH TH' EVENT WAS DIRE,
HATEFUL TO UTTER: BUT WHAT POWER OF MIND
OF KNOWLEDGE PAST OR PRESENT, COULD HAVE FEAR'D,
AS STOOD LIKE THESE, COULD EVER KNOW REPULSE? [ 630 ]
THAT ALL THESE PUISSANT LEGIONS, WHOSE EXILE
SELF-RAIS'D, AND REPOSSESS THIR NATIVE SEAT?
IF COUNSELS DIFFERENT, OR DANGER SHUN'D
MONARCH IN HEAV'N, TILL THEN AS ONE SECURE
CONSENT OR CUSTOME, AND HIS REGAL STATE [ 640 ]
WHICH TEMPTED OUR ATTEMPT, AND WROUGHT OUR FALL.
SO AS NOT EITHER TO PROVOKE, OR DREAD
TO WORK IN CLOSE DESIGN, BY FRAUD OR GUILE
AT LENGTH FROM US MAY FIND, WHO OVERCOMES
SPACE MAY PRODUCE NEW WORLDS; WHEREOF SO RIFE [ 650 ]
INTENDED TO CREATE, AND THEREIN PLANT
SHOULD FAVOUR EQUAL TO THE SONS OF HEAVEN:
OUR FIRST ERUPTION, THITHER OR ELSEWHERE: [ 655 ]
CAELESTIAL SPIRITS IN BONDAGE, NOR TH' ABYSS
FULL COUNSEL MUST MATURE: PEACE IS DESPAIRD, [ 660 ]
OPEN OR UNDERSTOOD MUST BE RESOLV'D.
HE SPAKE: AND TO CONFIRM HIS WORDS, OUT-FLEW
OF MIGHTY CHERUBIM; THE SUDDEN BLAZE [ 665 ]
AGAINST THE HIGHEST, AND FIERCE WITH GRASPED ARMS
HURLING DEFIANCE TOWARD THE VAULT OF HEAV'N.
THERE STOOD A HILL NOT FAR WHOSE GRIESLY TOP [ 670 ]
SHON WITH A GLOSSIE SCURFF, UNDOUBTED SIGN
THE WORK OF SULPHUR. THITHER WING'D WITH SPEED
OF PIONERS WITH SPADE AND PICKAX ARM'D
OR CAST A RAMPART. MAMMON LED THEM ON,
FROM HEAV'N, FOR EV'N IN HEAV'N HIS LOOKS AND THOUGHTS [ 680 ]
THE RICHES OF HEAV'NS PAVEMENT, TROD'N GOLD,
IN VISION BEATIFIC: BY HIM FIRST
RANSACK'D THE CENTER, AND WITH IMPIOUS HANDS
FOR TREASURES BETTER HID. SOON HAD HIS CREW
AND DIG'D OUT RIBS OF GOLD. LET NONE ADMIRE [ 690 ]
DESERVE THE PRECIOUS BANE. AND HERE LET THOSE
OF BABEL, AND THE WORKS OF MEMPHIAN KINGS
AND STRENGTH AND ART ARE EASILY OUT-DONE
WHAT IN AN AGE THEY WITH INCESSANT TOYLE
NIGH ON THE PLAIN IN MANY CELLS PREPAR'D, [ 700 ]
SLUC'D FROM THE LAKE, A SECOND MULTITUDE
SEVERING EACH KIND, AND SCUM'D THE BULLION DROSS:
A VARIOUS MOULD, AND FROM THE BOYLING CELLS
AS IN AN ORGAN FROM ONE BLAST OF WIND
ANON OUT OF THE EARTH A FABRICK HUGE [ 710 ]

WHOSE MIDNIGHT REVELS, BY A FORREST SIDE
OR DREAMS HE SEES, WHILE OVER-HEAD THE MOON
WHEELS HER PALE COURSE, THEY ON THIR MIRTH AND DANCE

REDUC'D THIR SHAPES IMMENSE, AND WERE AT LARGE, [ 790 ]
OF THAT INFERNAL COURT. BUT FAR WITHIN
